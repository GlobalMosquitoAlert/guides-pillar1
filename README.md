# Real-Time Targeted Vector Mosquito Monitoring

Global Mosquito Alert Consortium Best Practices Guide

The Global Mosquito Alert Consortium's (GMAC's) best practices guides offer experiences gained from a variety of projects that use citizen science to better understand and combat disease-vector mosquitoes. The goal is to create a growing repository of information about how best to use and customize the GMACâ€™s citizen science toolkit for local implementation.

The present guide encompasses Pillar 1 of the GMAC toolkit: real-time targeted vector mosquito monitoring. This is a set of tools that enable citizen scientists to identify and report adult mosquitoes, and that facilitate the subsequent validation and analysis of these reports. As references, this guide draws on several existing projects: Mosquito Alert, iNaturalist, Muggen Radar, and Abuzz.
